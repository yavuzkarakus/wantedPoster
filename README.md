### 👾 What I learned

I learned a lot from this assignment. I came to the conclusion that JavaScript is actually the most enjoyable software language because this time I was very happy to see a good result. There is a lot of audio integration in the project. While adding these sounds, I reinforced a certain part of JavaScript. I also learned how to generate a random element on a page using the Math library.

JS Code Snippet:

```js
let left = Math.random() * (poster.clientWidth - bulletHole.width);
let top = Math.random() * (poster.clientHeight - bulletHole.height);
bulletHole.style.left = left + "px";
bulletHole.style.top = top + "px";
```

### 🤖 Continued development

Especially after this assignment, I started to think that web development is actually a more enjoyable process than I thought. Of course, I will continue to improve and become a good web developer.
